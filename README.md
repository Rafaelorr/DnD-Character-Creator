# Dungeons-and-Dragons-Character-Creator

After learning how to code Python, I decided to test my learning by making something fun!
This script generates a character with everything randomized from stats to physical appearance.

I just learned how to code Python (my first language) and I thought making something for my D&D group would be fun.

It is quite long because it is a lot of repetition to cover the large amount of options for races, classes, etc.

I wrote it in a way that is easy for me to edit if I want to add or remove things, so I doubt it's very clean or streamlined by normal standards.

I've included all of the official Wizards of the Coast stuff as well as some homebrew that I found.

I am very new to coding and still barely know what I'm doing, so I appreciate any feedback that comes my way :)
